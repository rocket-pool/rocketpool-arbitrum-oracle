# Rocket Pool rETH Exchange Rate Oracle for Arbitrum

This repository contains 2 main contracts. `RocketArbitrumPriceMessenger` which can be called by anyone to submit the current
rETH exchange rate (as reported by `RocketNetworkBalances`) to the `RocketArbitrumPriceOracle` contract which is deployed on
Arbitrum.

## Notice

Rocket Pool provides this exchange rate oracle as-is for convenience and offers no guarantee about its accuracy or the
freshness of the data. These contracts have not been formally audited for security or correctness.

## Usage

Calling `rate()` on `RocketArbitrumPriceOracle` will return the latest rETH exchange rate reported. This value is in the form
of the ETH value of 1 rETH. e.g. If 1 rETH is worth 1.5 ETH `rate()` will return 1.5e18. `lastUpdated()` can be called to
retrieve the timestamp that the rate was last updated.

## Deployments

Rocket Pool maintains a Goerli testnet instance of the protocol alongside our mainnet deployment which can be used for
integration testing before promotion to mainnet.

## Deploying and Submitting

There is a simple deploy script (`deploy.js`) that can be run with `node deploy.js`. You will need to create a suitable
`.env` file first. Example `.env` file is available for Goerli and Mainnet.

There is a script which will execute the `submitRate` function on the `RocketArbitrumPriceMessenger` (`submit.js`). After
setting up a suitable `.env` file, run with `node submit.js`.
